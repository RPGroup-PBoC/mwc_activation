# 2019-02-04 Promoter Screening

## Purpose
This experiment serves as a replicate xanthosine titration experiment hitting
the low end of xanthosine concentration.

## Strains
| **Location** | **Plasmid** | **Genotype** | **Shorthand** |
|:--| :--| :--| :--| 
|`Box 1-XX`| `N/A`| *xapABR::FRT-FRT* | `∆xap`|
|`Box 1-XX`| `N/A`| *galK::27-YFP, xapABR::FRT-FRT* | `wt-YFP`|
|`Box 1-XX`| *pN25-tetR*| *ybcN::1-xapR-mCherry, galK::27-YFP, xapABR::FRT-FRT*| `wt-YFP + xapR`|

## Inducer concentrations
| **Inducer** | **Shorthand**| **Concentration(s)** |
|:--|:--| :--|
| Anhydrous tetracycline| ATC| 10 \[ng/mL\]|
| Xanthosine dihydrate | XAN | 0, 0.05, 0.1 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 11.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4 \[mg/mL\]|

## Notes & Observations

## Processing Files

### Cell Husbandry
1. All strains given in the table above were grown in LB + appropriate
   antibiotic overnight (reaching saturation) and were in stationary phase. 
2. The previous night, the appropriate amount of Xanthosine was weighed into the
  appropriate 15 mL Falcon tubes.
3. The following morning, 3 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose was added to each tube (±
   xanthosine) followed by the appropriate antibiotic (if necessary) and
   concentration of ATC. ATC was diluted from 1µg/mL stock. 
4. Cells were diluted 1000 fold into the media and allowed to grow for ~ 8 hours
   shaking 225 rpm at 37°C. The tubes were shielded from light to prevent
   photocleavage of the ATC. 
5. After 8 hours, the cultures were removed from incubation and prepared for
  flow cytometry.

## Flow Cytometry
1. Cells were diluted 1:10 into M9 minimal medium with no supplemented carbon to
  suppress growth and further expression.
2. Cells were flowed using a Chill5 rack with the following instrument settings:

3. Once complete, the machine was cleaned and washed and files were transferred
   to local storage.
