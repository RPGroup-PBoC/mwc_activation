# 2019-01-22 Strain Screening

## Purpose 
In this experiment, strains used for the dilution experiments are tested across
two ATC and Xanthosine concentrations.

## Strains

| **Location** | **Plasmid** | **Genotype** | **Shorthand** |
|:--| :--| :--| :--| 
|`Box 1-XX`| `N/A`| *xapABR::FRT-FRT* | `âˆ†xap`|
|`Box 1-XX`| `N/A`| *galK::28-YFP, xapABR::FRT-FRT* |`simp-YFP`|
|`Box 1-XX`| `N/A`| *galK::27-YFP, xapABR::FRT-FRT* | `wt-YFP`|
|`Box 1-XX`| *pN25-tetR*| *ybcN::1-xapR-mCherry, galK::28-YFP, xapABR::FRT-FRT*| `simp-YFP + xapR`|
|`Box 1-XX`| *pN25-tetR*| *ybcN::1-xapR-mCherry, galK::27-YFP, xapABR::FRT-FRT*| `wt-YFP + xapR`|

## Inducer concentrations
| **Inducer** | **Shorthand**| **Concentration(s)** |
|:--|:--| :--|
| Anhydrous tetracycline| ATC| 0, 10 \[ng/mL\]|
| Xanthosine dihydrate | XAN | 0, 10 \[mg/mL\]|
