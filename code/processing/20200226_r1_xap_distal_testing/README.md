# 2020-02-26 Xap Distal Testing

## Purpose
The purpose of this experiment was to perform a simple testing of the new lacUV5
construct with the distal xapR binding site inserted into our standard promoter
sequence. 

## Strains
| **Location** | **Plasmid** | **Genotype** | **Shorthand** |
|:--| :--| :--| :--| 
|`Box 1-50`| `N/A`| *galK::xD-YFP, xabABR::FRT-FRT* | `delta`|
|`Box 1-51`| `N/A`| *galK::xD-YFP, ybcN::1-xapR-mCherry, xapABR::FRT-FRT* | `xd`|


## Titration Series
| **Inducer** | **Shorthand**| **Concentration(s)** |
|:--|:--| :--|
| Anhydrotetracycline| ATC| 0, 10 \[ng/mL\]|
| Xanthosine dihydrate | XAN | 0,  4 \[mg/mL\]|


## Notes and Observations
* The xanthosine concentrations were achieved by directly adding ~ 12 mg of
  Xanthosine to the tubes in which it is desired
* The ∆xapR strain seemed to be less dense than the other cultures and there
  were more filamentous cells when viewed under the microscope. It is not clear
  why this is the case. 

## Microscope Settings. 
| **Channel** | **Bit & Gain** | **Exposure** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Brightfield | 12bit and Gain 1 | 75 ms| 
| YFP | 12bit and Gain 4 | 500 ms|
| mCherry| 12bit and Gain 4 | 250 ms|

## Experimental Protocol. 
1. Strains were grown overnight in LB + appropriate antibiotic to saturation
   overnight at 37° C with aeration. 
2. In the morning, cultures were diluted 1:1000 into fresh media supplemented
   with ATC and XAN where appropriate. 
3. Cultures were allowed to grow for ~ 7 hours at 37°C with aeration and
   shielded from light. 
5. Once at an OD(600nm) of ~ 0.3, approximately 1µL of the culture was spotted
   onto 2% agarose pads and allowed to dry. 
6. Samples were then imaged with 3 - 5 positions per pad and the images were
   deposited to the backup server.
