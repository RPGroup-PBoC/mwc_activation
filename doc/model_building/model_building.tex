\section{A first pass at simple activation model}

The seemingly obvious starter model for our simple activation system is a model with four states, i.e.,
empty promoter, RNAP bound promoter, activator bound promoter, and finally RNAP and activator both bound.
An equilibrium version of this was proposed in~\cite{Bintu2005b},
but if we want to consider observables beyond mean expression levels,
we need to consider a kinetic/master equation model.
The most general version of this picture is shown in \fref{fig:4state}.
(Our attention for now is on promoter states,
ignoring mRNA production, decay, and MWC parameters for XapR.)
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{./simple_act.ai}
    \end{center}
    \caption{

            in particular to and from the doubly bound state versus the singly bound states.
            }
    \label{fig:4state}
\end{figure}
Even before considering transcription initiation rates, mRNA degradation rates,
or MWC parameters for XapR, which will collectively add at least five more parameters,
\fref{fig:4state} has eight model parameters.
Such a large number will prove difficult, at best, to infer from experiments.
This parameter proliferation highlights a serious difficulty of such a master equation model,
relative to the more economical equilibrium models.

We would like to make some assumptions to simplify this situation,
for which we propose the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set association rates equal for the singly and doubly bound states,
        i.e., assume $\rate{k}{P}{+} = \rate{\tilde{k}}{P}{+}$ and
        $\rate{k}{R}{+} = \rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{+}$.
        If association rates for XapR and RNAP are close to the diffusion limit,
        as some evidence indicates for other transcription factors (\mmnote{need cite!}),
        this implies that they bind to their specific target with high probability,
        once they are in its vicinity.
        In other words, most of their mean search time (which is 1/(on rate))
        is spent not in close proximity to their target.
        So the presence or absence of another molecular player bound at their target site should have little influence;
        either way they bind quickly, with high probability, upon arrival.
    \item If XapR and RNAP bind and unbind reversibly,
        meaning no energy is consumed and no entropy produced,
        then the cycle condition allows us to eliminate one rate
        (by expressing it as a simple algebraic function of the others).
        This condition holds even when (irreversible) transcription initiation is
        reintroduced.\footnote{This is an example of a more general result \mmnote{cite Hill's little book}.
        In an arbitrarily complicated diagram at a nonequilibrium steady-state,
        the product of forward rates around any closed path divided by reverse rates
        equals exp(free energy change around that path).}
        Note that which algebraic choices lead to the ``best'' or ``simplest'' model is not always obvious.
    \item If there is no detectable gene expression in the absence of XapR,
        as Griffin's preliminary experiments suggest,
        then we would like to excise the singly-bound RNAP state from the cartoon.
        Then there are two possible ways to proceed.
        One is to link the empty and doubly bound states with two effective rates (one each direction).
        If there is some separation of timescales between RNAP and XapR rates,
        the error from this approximation should be negligible.
        \label{item:excise_and_patch_p}
    \item The second and more drastic option, if no expression is detectable in absence of XapR,
        is to excise the RNAP bound state \textit{and} the rates leading to and from it.
        This reduces the cartoon to a three-state chain, topologically the same as our usual Lac cartoon,
        but with the roles of empty and transcription factor bound states reversed.
        This reversal is critical: some experiments that were done to infer parameters in Lac
        become either more difficult or impossible.
        This model has the same structure and same number of parameters to be fit as in Lac,
        even when we incorporate MWC model for XapR plus mRNA initiation and degradation rates.
        But again, the role reveral of empty and transcription factor bound promoter
        and the reversal of the transcription factor allosteric $\Delta\epsilon$
        will present extra experimental challenges.
    \item If on the other hand gene expression \textit{does} prove detectable in the absence of XapR,
        we cannot remove the RNAP bound state.
        This situation would reduce the scope for theory to simplify the cartoon,
        but as compensation it would make possible additional experiments
        which could independently determine some model parameters.
    \item The XapR rates in \fref{fig:4state} are implicitly only for the allosterically active state.
        As with LacI, it seems reasonable to assume that the other allosteric state
        does not bind specifically to its target binding site
        (it may bind DNA, but its binding to the target site is no stronger than to background DNA).
\end{enumerate}

The above list is presented as a buffet,
from which we may end up sampling all, some, or none of the options.

\subsection{Replacing RNAP singly bound state with effective rates}
Let us explore option \ref{item:excise_and_patch_p} in more detail.
First we point out that even for LacUV5, a ``strong'' promoter,
the weak promoter approximation has proven excellent.
In equilibrium, weak promoter means $P/K_P \ll 1$, or put differently,
the occupation probability of the RNAP bound state is small compared to the empty state.
It is hard to imagine the Xap promoter being stronger than LacUV5,
and given the low expression seen so far, it could be much weaker.
Assuming the activator XapR activates as strongly as it appears,
the doubly bound state should also have a much higher occupation probability.
Furthermore, we should expect to find a timescale separation
between the RNAP rates and the XapR rates.
If both (second order) on rates are on the order of the diffusion limit,
but the copy number of XapR is small compared to RNAP,
then the (first order) RNAP on rate should be larger than that for XapR by the same ratio.
Also, RNAP's binding to its specific sites is generally weaker than
bacterial transcription factors' specific site binding,
due to the far larger number of sites RNAP must recognize.
Essentially then, the singly bound RNAP state adds nothing but baggage to the model.
The timescale separation allows us to replace the singly bound RNAP site
with effective rates directly connecting the empty and doubly bound states.

What should be the effective rates? 
First consider unbinding from the doubly bound state.
If $\rate{k}{P}{-} \gg \rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}, \rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{+}$ as expected,
then when XapR unbinds from the doubly bound state,
it will be followed with high probability by RNAP unbinding.
And the waiting time for RNAP unbinding will be short compared to the time
that was \textit{already} waited in the doubly bound state for XapR to unbind.

More formally, we can compute the total mean waiting time as
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{\rate{k}{eff}{-}}
    = \frac{1}{\rate{k}{P}{-}} + \frac{1}{\rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}}
    = \frac{\rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-} + \rate{k}{P}{-}}
           {\rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}   \rate{k}{P}{-}}
    = \frac{1}{\rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}}
        \left(
        \left( 1 + \frac{\rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}}{\rate{k}{P}{-}}\right)^{-1}
        \right)^{-1}.
\end{align}
So far this is exact, but using the assumption that
$\rate{k}{P}{-} \gg \rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}$, we have
\begin{align}
    \rate{k}{eff}{-}
    = \rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}
        \left( 1 + \frac{\rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}}{\rate{k}{P}{-}}\right)^{-1}
    \approx \rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}
        \left( 1 - \frac{\rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}}{\rate{k}{P}{-}}\right)
    \approx \rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}.
\end{align}

Now condsider $\rate{k}{eff}{+}$,
the effective on rate from the empty state to the doubly bound state.
This is more subtle because now the slow step is second rather than first.
The intuition is that $\rate{k}{eff}{+}$ should be approximately
$\rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{+}$, multiplied by a reduction factor which accounts for
the higher occupation probability of the empty state relative to
its actual origin point (the RNAP bound state).
If the separation of timescales is strong,
this ratio is approximately $\rate{k}{P}{+}/\rate{k}{P}{-}$,
so $\rate{k}{eff}{+} \approx
    \rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{+}\times\rate{k}{P}{+}/\rate{k}{P}{-}$.
\mmnote{I can come back and do this more carefully at some point,
but this is at the same level of accuracy as saying
$\rate{k}{eff}{-} \approx \rate{\tilde{k}}{R}{-}$.
Doing both at least preserves detailed balance so means are unaffected.}

\section{Reference for a simple-minded theorist with poor memory}

\subsection{Strains}
We have available five strains that are potentially useful/interesting:

1) $\Delta$\textit{XapA,B,R} (all knocked out).
Recall \textit{XapR} is just a bit downstream from \textit{XapA} \& \textit{B}.

2) Same as 1), but with wild type promoter (of \textit{XapA,B}) driving YFP.

3) wild type system, plus, at a separate locus, wt promoter driving YFP.

4) $\Delta$\textit{XapA,B,R}, YFP controlled by wt promoter,
\textit{XapR-mCh} under control of TetR (our standard dilution circuit)

5) like 4), except upstream binding site in wt promoter is knocked out.
This is the simple activation test vehicle.
